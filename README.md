# Spawnmon

Similar to [concurrently]() or [run-all] but with a few tweaks to make life easier. In particular when a watch stream goes initially stale or is idle.

Also built in helpers for pinging a socket ensuring it's live and then firing off another event.

...check back soon work in progress, working out kinks, feel free to comment on Github.
